# Registers



| Register       | Description                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |
| -------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `R0`-`R30`     | 31 general-purpose registers, named`R0` to `R30`.                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `SP`           | A 64-bit dedicated **Stack Pointer **register. The least significant 32 bits of the stack pointer can be accessed using the register name `WSP`. The use of `SP` as an operand in an instruction, indicates the use of the current stack pointer. |
| `PC`           | A 64-bit **Program Counter** holding the address of the current instruction. Software cannot write directly to the `PC`. It can only be updated on a branch, exception entry or exception return.                                                 |
| `FPCR`, `FPSR` | Two Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) and Floating Point (FP) control and status registers, `FPCR` and `FPSR`.                                                                                                                             |
| `V0`-`V31`     | 32 Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) and Floating Point (FP) registers, named `V0` to `V31`                                                                                                                                                |



### Register naming convention

#### General purpose registers

In the AArch64 application level view, an Arm processing element has: `R0`-`R30` 31 general-purpose registers, `R0` to `R30`. Each register can be accessed as:

* A 64-bit general-purpose register named `X0` to `X30`.
* A 32-bit general-purpose register named `W0` to `W30`.

#### SIMD and floating-point registers

Each SIMD\&FP register (from `V0` to `V31`) can be accessed as:

* A 128-bit register named `Q0` to `Q31`.
* A 64-bit register named `D0` to `D31`.
* A 32-bit register named `S0` to `S31`.
* A 16-bit register named `H0` to `H31`.
* An 8-bit register named `B0` to `B31`.
* A 128-bit vector of elements.
* A 64-bit vector of elements.

Where the number of bits described by a register name does not occupy an entire Single instruction, multiple data (SIMD) and Floating Point (FP) register, it refers to the least significant bits.
