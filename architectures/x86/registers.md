# Registers

### Registers on x86 and x64

#### General Purpose Registers (GPRs)

There is 8 General Purpose Registers (GPRs) in x86 and x64 architectures.

| x86   | x64   | Name                                                                        | Function |
| ----- | ----- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------- | -------- |
| `EAX` | `RAX` | Accumulator & Used in arithmetic operations                                 |          |
| `EBX` | `RBX` | Base & Used as a pointer to data                                            |          |
| `ECX` | `RCX` | Counter & Used in shift/rotate instructions and loops                       |          |
| `EDX` | `RDX` | Data & Used in arithmetic operations and I/O operations                     |          |
| `ESP` | `RSP` | Stack Pointer & Pointer to the top of the stack                             |          |
| `EBP` | `RBP` | Stack Base Pointer & Used to point to the base of the stack                 |          |
| `ESI` | `RSI` | Source Index & Used as a pointer to a source in stream operations           |          |
| `EDI` | `RDI` | Destination Index & Used as a pointer to a destination in stream operations |          |

#### Segment Registers

There is 6 Segment Registers (extremely useful in Operating Systems course) :

| Symbol | Name          | Function                                               |
| ------ | ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| `SS`   | Stack Segment | Pointer to the stack                                   |
| `CS`   | Code Segment  | Pointer to the code                                    |
| `DS`   | Data Segment  | Pointer to the data                                    |
| `ES`   | Extra Segment | Pointer to extra data ('E' stands for 'Extra')         |
| `FS`   | F Segment     | Pointer to more extra data ('F' comes after 'E')       |
| `GS`   | G Segment     | Pointer to still more extra data ('G' comes after 'F') |

#### `EFLAGS` Register

The EFLAGS is a 32-bit register used as a collection of bits representing Boolean values to store the results of operations and the state of the processor.
