# ELF Dynamic Linking

Shared libraries are compiled as position independent code. Whenever an executable program is loaded in the memory to be run, the kernel sets up the stack. The bottom of the stack (highest address) is filled with an **auxiliary vector**.

```c
typedef struct
{
  uint64_t a_type; /* Entry type */
  union
  {
    uint64_t a_val; /* Integer value */
  } a_un;
} Elf64_auxv_t;
```

The types include program headers (and its size), entry point, page size, etc. The dynamic linker uses details from this auxiliary vector to resolve symbols.
