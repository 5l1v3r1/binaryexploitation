# ELF Types (e\_type)

1. **ET\_REL**: _Relocatable_ file. These are generally **Position Independent Code**. The code and data has not been linked to an executable. Also called _object files_.
2. **ET\_EXEC**: _Executable_ file. The file has an entry point and can be executed. Various object (relocatable) files are linked together at **compile-time** to produce an executable. Also called _program_.
3. **ET\_DYN**: _Shared_ object. This is a dynamically linked object file. These can be directly loaded and linked to a program's process at **runtime**. Also called _shared library_.
4. **ET\_CORE**: _Core_ file. This is a dump of the process's state at the time of a program crash.
5. **ET\_NONE**: Unkown type.
