# ELF Relocations

Relocation is the process of connecting symbolic references with symbolic definitions. Relocation entries are meant for this purpose. Relocations involve binary patching.

There are two types of relocation entries:

```c
/* Implicit addends - The addend is stored in at the place where relocation occurs */
typedef struct {
  Elf64_Addr r_offset;
  uint64_t r_info;
} Elf64_Rel;

typedef struct {
  Elf64_Addr r_offset; /* Points to the location that requires relocation */
  uint64_t r_info; /* Symbol table index and type of relocation */
  int64_t r_addend; /* Specifies a constant addend */
} Elf64_Rela;
```
