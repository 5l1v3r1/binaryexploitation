# .got - Global Offset Table

## Theory

A function call to a function present in some external shared library is resolved using PLT and GOT. Call to `func` is actually a call to `func@plt`. The PLT function jumps to an address in GOT, pushes an index on the stack and then jumps to a common PLT function. The index pushed is actually an index in the `.rel.plt` table section that contains a particular relocation entry for that symbol (referencing that function).

The address in GOT is the relocation offset for `func`. Initially that address points to the push instruction in PLT.

The first three GOT address are reserved:

* GOT\[0] - points to the dymanic segment of the executable
* GOT\[1] - points to the `link_map` structure
* GOT\[2] - points to `_dl_runtime_resolve()`

The common PLT function calls GOT\[2] with arguments GOT\[1] and the index pushed.
