# ELF Symbols

Symbols are simple symbolic references to any function variable, etc. There are two symbol tables: `.dynsym` and `.symtab`. The former contains references to external sources (shared libraries). The latter contains both external as well as local references. Only the `.dynsym` is needed for program execution as the dynamic linker needs to resolve these references at run time. `.symtab` only helps in debugging and linking.

```c
typedef struct {
  uint32_t st_name; /* Offset into the corresponding table's string table */
  unsigned char st_info; /* Symbol type and binding attributes */
  unsigned char st_other; /* Symbol visibility */
  uint16_t st_shndx; /* Each symbol is defined for a particular section */
  Elf64_Addr st_value; /* Either an address or offset */
  uint64_t st_size; /* Size of the actual reference */
} Elf64_Sym; /* A single entry in any of the symbol table */
```

These are the different symbol **types**:

1. **STT\_NOTYPE**: Undefined type.
2. **STT\_FUNC**: Function or executable code.
3. **STT\_OBJECT**: Data object.

There are the different symbol **bindings**:

1. **STB\_LOCAL**: Local symbols (static variables and functions).
2. **STB\_GLOBAL**: Symbols visible to all object files.
3. **STB\_WEAK**: Same as global, with less precedence. Can be overriden by another symbol having the same name but not marked as STB\_WEAK.
