# Dangerous functions

### gets

#### Function prototype

```c
char * gets(char * str)
```

#### Usecase

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character).

#### ⚠️ Vulnerability

The `gets()` function assumes that the buffer pointed by `char * str` given in parameters is large enougth to contain the given user input. As  the `gets()` does not validate the length of the user's inputs, an attacker can enter an arbitrary long input to overflow the buffer pointed by `char * str`.

### strcpy

Function prototype:

```c
char * strcpy(char * dest, const char * src)
```

Usecase:

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character)



### sprintf

Function prototype:

```c
int sprintf(char * str, const char * format, ...)
```

Usecase:

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character)



### strcat

Function prototype:

```c
char * strcat(char * dest, const char * src)
```

Usecase:

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character)
