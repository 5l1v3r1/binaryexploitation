# Dangerous functions

The following functions are known to be vulnerable to buffer overflows:

### gets

#### Function prototype

```c
char * gets(char * str)
```

#### Use case

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character).

#### ⚠️ Vulnerability

The `gets()` function assumes that the buffer pointed by `char * str` given in parameters is large enough to contain the given user input. As  the `gets()` does not validate the length of the user's inputs, an attacker can enter an arbitrary long input to overflow the buffer pointed by `char * str`.



### strcpy

#### Function prototype

```c
char * strcpy(char * dest, const char * src)
```

#### Use case

The `strcpy()` is used to copy characters from a source string (pointed by `char * src` ) to a destination string (pointed by `char * dest` ).

#### ⚠️ Vulnerability

This function does not validate the length of the two buffers to check if copying one onto another will trigger an overflow. If an attacker controls the length of the source string (pointed by `char * src` ) it is possible to overflow the buffer pointed by `char * dest`.



### sprintf

#### Function prototype

```c
int sprintf(char * str, const char * format, ...)
```

#### Use case

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character)

#### ⚠️ Vulnerability





### strcat

#### Function prototype

```c
char * strcat(char * dest, const char * src)
```

#### Use case

The `gets()` is used to read characters (until it reaches a newline or end-of-stream character)

#### ⚠️ Vulnerability
